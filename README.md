Main idea of this activity is to provide web terminal service for github repository.
Instead of web surfing using web GUI, small web terminal would provide 'ls', 'cat', 'cd', command line tools to explore github repository on the web browser.
This way, we don't need to checkout github repositories that we are interested in in order to take a look inside of the repository.
